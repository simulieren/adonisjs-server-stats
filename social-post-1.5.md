# Social Posts — adonisjs-server-stats v1.5

## Discord

hey everyone! **adonisjs-server-stats** just crossed **1.8k downloads** — thanks to everyone trying it out!

here's what shipped since v1.2:

- **full-page dashboard (nice alternative for API users)** (`/__stats`) with 11 sections — requests, queries, events, logs, emails, cache, jobs, config, and more. backed by local SQLite so data persists across restarts.
- **dark/light theme** with system preference detection and manual toggle.
- **overview widgets** — top events, email activity, log levels, cache stats, job queue, response distribution, slowest queries. everything deep-links with filters.

try it out: `npm install adonisjs-server-stats@latest`

npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/adonisjs-server-stats

**adonisjs-server-stats hit 1.8k downloads — here's what's new since v1.2**

thanks to everyone who's been using the package! quick recap of what shipped:

- **full-page dashboard** (`/__stats`) with 11 sections — requests, queries, events, logs, emails, cache, jobs, config, and more. all backed by local SQLite so data persists across restarts.
- **dark/light theme** that follows your system preference with a manual toggle.
- **overview widgets** — top events, email activity, log levels, cache stats, job queue status, response distribution, slowest queries. everything deep-links with filters.
- **request tracing** — per-request waterfall timelines showing queries, events, and spans.
- **big internal refactor** — cut ~400 lines from the controller, extracted shared utilities, fixed a bunch of bugs with live updates and field name mismatches.

it's a drop-in monitoring dashboard for AdonisJS v6 apps. try it out:

`npm install adonisjs-server-stats@latest`
